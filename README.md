## Install

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   1. You can also use the `prepare.sh` script to install system dependencies using apt.
1. Set up a OAUTH provider (like Keycloak: Confidential OIDC client, without Direct Grants should work fine. Admins should have `admin` in `group` claim list).
1. Modify [CTFd/config.ini](https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd/blob/master/CTFd/config.ini) to your liking. Configure OAUTH variables there.
1. Use `python serve.py` or `flask run` in a terminal to drop into debug mode.

You can use the auto-generated Docker images with the following command:

`docker run -p 8000:8000 -it ctfd/ctfd`

Or you can use Docker Compose with the following command from the source repository:

`docker-compose up`

## Footer

You can add a footer through the admin interface. We recommend using this template (although you can enter any valid HTML):

```html
<footer class="footer">
  <div class="container text-center">
    Your footer text
  </div>
</footer>
```
